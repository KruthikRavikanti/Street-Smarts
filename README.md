## üí° Inspiration

The inspiration behind the creation of the Street Smarts platform stems from a commitment to enhancing human interaction within urban environments, aiming to foster a sense of community and belonging that counters the isolation and anonymity often found in densely populated areas. This platform is designed to be a dynamic, interactive hub for city residents, providing live updates on local safety, new businesses, traffic changes, and more, thus keeping citizens well-informed and engaged with their surroundings. Beyond just disseminating information, 

Street Smarts actively involves its users in the urban discourse by highlighting key community issues, spurring policy recommendations, and facilitating meaningful communication among commuters and residents in similar areas. This approach not only assists with practical aspects of city living but also plays a crucial role in strengthening the social fabric of urban communities, transforming the experience of city living into one that is more connected, informed, and community-focused.

## üíª What it does

We made an app prototype for citizens in cities to connect with each other and share new experiences. These experiences can range from simple road updates to extravagant events. Additionally, app users can also promote policies that they would like to see implemented.

Users log into the app with Google accounts and view a feed of friends' posts, reacting with emojis. They can post photos with descriptions, which appear on the feed. The "search policies" tab offers three categories of top weekly city issues for users to explore, like solutions, or propose new ones. A profile page shows engagement stats and a list of quests to be completed. 

We created a Power BI visualization to serve as a data repository and mapping function. All app data is compiled and undergoes analysis that can be shared with policy-makers and allows for transparency of user data usage. 

Users first choose a specific region within the city, Atlanta in this example, so that the map can zoom accordingly to reveal all activity in that area. Using NLP techniques, sentimental analysis is conducted on each post to determine whether the update is positive, negative, or neutral in nature. Users can then filter the records by each sentiment category. Those looking for community events may search for positive entries while those watching for road delays may look at the negative entries. A bar graph will update to display the total number of posts per sentiment category in the selected region creating a comprehensive view of engagement across the city. 
Safety is critical to creating a well-trusted city. Users looking to stay alert about the latest traffic accident information can choose their region once again and view all recorded accidents categorized by their severity. Policy-makers can track areas with the highest rate of accidents and aim to install speed bumps, traffic lights, or other such precautionary measures.

Our goal is to provide mapping functionality to compare activity across popular areas within the city.
