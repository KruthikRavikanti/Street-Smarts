# Street-Smarts
Keep citizens aware of local activity with live updates of safety issues, traffic patterns changes, new infrastructure, and more. Highlight topical issues to establish urgency and lead to policy recommendations. Connect commuters within a specific mile radius allowing them to share their experiences and issues.
